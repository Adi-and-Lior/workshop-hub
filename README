# Workshop Hub

Final project for the React course (Assignment H-2).
A Single Page Application (SPA) for managing and registering for workshops.

## Project Description
The application allows users to browse a catalog of workshops, filter them by category and city, view detailed information including mentors, and add new workshops to the system.

## Tech Stack
* React 18 (Vite)
* React Router DOM - For navigation management
* Context API - For global state management
* Bulma CSS - For styling

## Routes and Pages
The application uses React Router to manage the following pages:

* Home Page (/): Main catalog page. It fetches workshop data and the city list using Promise.all and implements client-side filtering. Data is passed to WorkshopCard components via props.
* Add Workshop Page (/add-workshop): A page to add new workshops. It uses a single state object for form data with validation, features city autocomplete using the Israeli Government API, and handles image file selection with preview.
* Workshop Details Page (/workshop/:id): Displays specific information from MockAPI based on the URL ID. It fetches random mentors from the randomuser.me API and displays badges based on difficulty level.
* Not Found Page (*): Handles 404 errors for invalid URLs.

## Global State (Context)
The project uses FavoritesContext to manage the user's favorite workshops:
* It stores the IDs of the workshops the user liked.
* The Navbar displays a counter showing the total number of favorite items.
* Workshop cards allow users to toggle the selection to add or remove workshops from the list.

## External APIs
1. MockAPI: Backend for storing and retrieving workshop data.
2. Data.gov.il: Provides the list of cities for the form and filters.
3. RandomUser: Generates placeholder data for mentors.

## How to Run
