# Workshop Hub 🎨

Final project for the React course (Assignment H-2).
A Single Page Application (SPA) for managing and registering for workshops.

## Project Description

The application allows users to browse a catalog of workshops, filter them by category and city, view detailed information including mentors, and add new workshops to the system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **React 18 (Vite)**
* **React Router DOM** (New: For navigation)
* **Context API** (New: For global state)
* **Bulma CSS** (For styling)

## 🚦 Routes & Pages

I used React Router to manage navigation between the following pages:

* **`/` - Home Page** (`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`)
  Main catalog page.
  * Fetches workshop data and city list using `Promise.all`.
  * Implements client-side filtering for both category and city.
  * Passes data to `WorkshopCard` components via props.

* **`/add-workshop` - Form Page** (`src/pages/FormPage.jsx`)
  A page to add new workshops.
  * Uses a single state object for form data with validation.
  * Features a city autocomplete input using the Israeli Government API.
  * Handles image file selection and preview.

* **`/workshop/:id` - Details Page** (`src/pages/WorkshopDetailsPage.jsx`)
  Displays specific workshop information.
  * Fetches workshop details from MockAPI based on the ID in the URL.
  * Fetches a list of random mentors from `randomuser.me` API.
  * Displays badges based on difficulty level.

* **`*` - Not Found Page** (`src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx`)
  Handles 404 errors for invalid URLs.

## ❤️ Global State (Context)

I created a `FavoritesContext` to manage the user's favorite workshops across the application.

* **What it stores:** A list of IDs of the workshops the user liked.
* **How it is used:**
  1. **Navbar:** Displays a counter showing the total number of favorite items.
  2. **Workshop Card:** Allows users to toggle the "Heart" button to add or remove a workshop from the list.

## 🌐 External APIs

1. **MockAPI:** Backend for storing workshop data.
2. **Data.gov.il:** Provides the list of cities for the form and filters.
3. **RandomUser:** Generates placeholder data for mentors.
